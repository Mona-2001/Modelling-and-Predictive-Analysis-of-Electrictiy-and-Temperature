# Modelling-and-Predictive-Analysis-of-Electrictiy-and-Temperature
The project demostrates modelling and predictive analysis using electricity and temperature data.
The data included was taken over a period of one month. After data collection, data manipulation and cleaning were applied to be able to use data and get useful insights.
Several graphs were developed as well as an interactive dashboard in attempt to make it more user friendly.
Insights and conclusions are provided in the notebook along with the graphs.
